/*In a library, for each book book-id, serial number (denotes copy number of a book), 
 * title, author, publisher and price are stored. Book-id and serial number together will be unique 
 * identifier for a book. Members are either student or faculty. Each member has unique member-id. 
 * Name, e-mail address are also to be stored. For any transaction (book issue or return),
 * members are supposed to place transactions slip. User will submit member-id, book-id, 
 * and serial number (only for book return). While processing a transaction, check the validity of the member. 
 * While issuing, availability of a copy of the book is to be checked. While returning a book, 
 * it is to be checked whether this copy was issued to the member or not. A student member can have 2 books issued 
 * at a point of time. For faculty members it is 10. Transaction information is to be stored 
 * like date of transaction, member-id, book-id, serial number, returned or not. 
 * An entry is made when book is issued and updated when the book is returned.
Design the classes and implement.*/
